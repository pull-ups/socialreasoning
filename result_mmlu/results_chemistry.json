This is false.\n2. **At least four sigma bonds**: Ethene has 6 sigma bonds (4 from C-H and 2 from C-C). This is true.\n3. **No sigma bonds**: This is false, as ethene has sigma bonds.\n4. **A trigonal planar configuration**: The carbon atoms in ethene are sp² hybridized, leading to a trigonal planar configuration around each carbon. This is true.\n5. **A tetrahedral configuration**: This is false, as ethene has a trigonal planar configuration, not tetrahedral.\n6. **At least three pi bonds**: Ethene has only one pi bond (from the double bond). This is false.\n7. **At least two pi bonds**: This is false for the same reason as above; ethene has only one pi bond.\n8. **Aromatic properties**: Ethene is not aromatic. This is false.\n9. **At least six sigma bonds**: Ethene has six sigma bonds, so this is true.\n\n### Step 3: Select the correct answer\nBased on the evaluations, the true statements about the simplest alkene (ethene) are:\n- At least four sigma bonds (True)\n- A trigonal planar configuration (True)\n- At least six sigma bonds (True)\n\nWould you like to confirm which of these options is the best answer, or do you want to discuss any specific points further?",
