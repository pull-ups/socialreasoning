Let's dive into step 1 and discuss the 1:2:4 resonance in detail.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the 1:2:4 Resonance\n\nThe 1:2:4 resonance refers to the orbital relationship between Jupiter's three largest moons: Io, Europa, and Ganymede. Specifically:\n\n- **Io** completes one orbit around Jupiter in about 1.8 days.\n- **Europa** completes one orbit in about 3.5 days, which is half of Io's orbital period (1:2).\n- **Ganymede** completes one orbit in about 7.2 days, which is a quarter of Io's orbital period (1:4).\n\nThis resonance means that for every orbit Io completes, Europa completes half an orbit, and Ganymede completes a quarter of an orbit. This gravitational interaction leads to significant tidal forces, which can affect the geological activity of these moons.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nNow that we have a clear understanding of the 1:2:4 resonance, we can move on to step 2, where we will evaluate each of the provided options. \n\nShall we proceed with evaluating the options?

The moons can be in various positions relative to each other during their orbits.\n\n### Evaluation of Option 1:\n- **True or False**: False\n- **Reasoning**: The resonance leads to periodic alignments, but they do not remain in a straight line at all times.\n\nShall we move on to option 2: \"It causes Io to rotate on its axis faster than it orbits Jupiter\"?

Meteor showers are typically caused by smaller particles (meteoroids) entering the atmosphere, not large meteorites disintegrating.\n\n2. **Near-Earth asteroids gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital paths. When the Earth passes through the orbit of an asteroid we are bombarded by sand-sized particles that cause a meteor shower.**\n   - **Evaluation**: This is partially correct. While near-Earth asteroids can contribute to meteor showers, they are not the primary source. Meteor showers are more commonly associated with comets.\n\n3. **Asteroid impacts elsewhere in the solar system throw sand-sized particles into space and occasionally the Earth passes through a cloud of these particles which burn up in our atmosphere and cause a meteor shower.**\n   - **Evaluation**: This is unlikely. While asteroid impacts can create debris, meteor showers are not primarily caused by this mechanism.\n\n4. **Meteor showers are caused by the Earth passing through a cloud of dust and debris left behind by the disintegration of planets in our solar system.**\n   - **Evaluation**: This is incorrect. Meteor showers are not typically associated with the disintegration of planets.\n\n5. **The gravitational pull of the moon causes rocks on its surface to be ejected into space. These rocks then enter Earth's atmosphere and cause a meteor shower.**\n   - **Evaluation**: This is incorrect. The moon's gravitational pull does not eject rocks into space that cause meteor showers.\n\n6. **Meteor showers are caused by the Earth passing through the tail of a comet, where dust and ice particles are left behind.**\n   - **Evaluation**: This is correct. Many meteor showers occur when Earth passes through the debris left by comets.\n\n7. **Meteor showers are caused by the Earth passing through a cloud of dust and debris left behind by the disintegration of distant stars.**\n   - **Evaluation**: This is incorrect. Meteor showers are not associated with the disintegration of stars.\n\n8. **Near-Earth asteroids disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a single location in the sky.**\n   - **Evaluation**: This is misleading. While meteors can appear to radiate from a point, they are not primarily caused by the disintegration of near-Earth asteroids.\n\n9. **Meteor showers are caused by the disintegration of satellites and space debris as they re-enter the Earth's atmosphere.**\n   - **Evaluation**: This is incorrect. Meteor showers are not caused by artificial satellites or space debris.\n\n10. **The nuclei of comets gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital paths. When the Earth passes through the orbit of a comet we are bombarded by sand-sized particles that cause a meteor shower.**\n    - **Evaluation**: This is correct.
