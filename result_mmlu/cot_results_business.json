The second blank should refer to the right of employees to know about their redundancy, which relates to \"Privacy\" or \"Autonomy.\"\n3.

It can be categorized as either a physical environment (the tangible aspects of the experience) or a more abstract environment (the emotional or social context).\n\nBased on these two dimensions, the four realms of experience are:\n\n1. **Entertainment**: Low customer participation, passive engagement in a physical environment.\n2. **Education**: Active customer participation, with a focus on learning in a physical environment.\n3. **Escapism**: High customer participation, where customers are fully immersed in an experience that may be more abstract or emotional.\n4. **Esthetic**: Low customer participation, but the experience is rich in sensory engagement, often in a physical environment.\n\nThese realms help businesses understand how to design experiences that resonate with customers based on their level of participation and the nature of the environment.",
