    "response": "To determine how polio can be eradicated, let's analyze each option step by step:\n\n1. **Herbal remedies**: There is no scientific evidence that herbal remedies can eradicate polio. They may provide some health benefits but are not effective against viral infections like polio.\n\n2. **Use of antibiotics**: Antibiotics are effective against bacterial infections, not viral infections. Polio is caused by a virus, so antibiotics will not help in eradicating it.\n\n3. **Regular intake of vitamins**: While vitamins can support overall health and immune function, they do not specifically target the poliovirus or prevent polio infection.\n\n4. **Administration of tetanus vaccine**: The tetanus vaccine is unrelated to polio. The polio vaccine (either inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) or oral polio vaccine (OPV)) is specifically designed to prevent polio.\n\n5. **Attention to sewage control and hygiene**: Improved sanitation and hygiene can help prevent the spread of polio, especially in areas where the virus is endemic. However, this alone will not eradicate polio without vaccination.\n\n6. **Natural immunity acquired through exposure**: While natural immunity can occur after infection, relying on natural exposure is not a safe or effective strategy for eradication, as it can lead to illness and complications.\n\n7. **Use of antiviral drugs**: Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs that effectively treat or prevent polio. The primary method of prevention is vaccination.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most effective way to eradicate polio is through **vaccination** (not listed in the options). While options 5 (attention to sewage control and hygiene) can help reduce transmission, the key to eradication is widespread vaccination.",
